			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Ryan.  As you will discover through my 
				examples, I love writing code for games.  It was in high 
				school, I would be playing a game with annoying bugs
				and glitches in them thinking to myself:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>&ldquo;I really wish I was 
				working with a videogame development company. 
				I would enjoy helping them fix the bugs in the code.&rdquo;</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				It was from that moment that I knew I wanted to pursue 
				a career in programming.  It is my dream to be a part
				of a major gaming company, helping them make their games
				as realistic, bug-free, and entertaining as possible
				for gamers to enjoy.  This is what lead me to pursue
				a Computer Science degree, which I obtained at Keene State College in 2015.
				Currently, I just recently completed the WorkReadyNH program in Manchester, NH.</p>
