		<h2>Program Tutor</h2>
			<p>At Keene State College, I worked as a tutor through the
			Aspire Program for three years.  Throughout the years, I have 
			worked with a variety of people, most of which enjoyed how well
			I re-explained concepts and how to apply them.  A few of them
			continued to work with me for multiple semesters, and a I even
			motivated and supported a couple of them into becoming tutors.

		<h2>Database Systems Mentor</h2>
			<p>During my senior year at Keene State, I was a mentor for
			the database systems class.  It was challenging and fun to work with
			students in database management and normalization to the application 
			of SQL.
			</p>
		<h2>Coursework</h2>
			<p>Initially during my first two years at Keene State, my work was confusing 
			to understand, be it skipping tasks in problem solving in my Calculus II course to
			sloppy code that had many unnecessary comments.  Over time, due to the feedback from my 
			Calc 2 professor and a.s the workload got challenging, I learned to show my work out completely
			and in a efficient manner.  As I continued to work with this professor in more advanced math classes,
			I eventually began to adopt this work ethic into my code, making it modularized and minimally commented.</p>
