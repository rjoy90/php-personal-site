					<h2>Work Experience</h2>
						</p>During my time at Keene State College,  I took on the challenge of tutoring.
							Several of my colleagues enjoyed my style of tutoring that they continued to		
							work with me throughout the years.  I even had a couple of them mention one time 
							that if they hadn't worked with me during college that
							they might not have been successful in their programming courses.</p>

					<h2>CS410 - Java Graphics Project</h2>
						<p>The project I made in Advanced Software Development was a remake of the card game FreeCell.
						Upon the end of this class, I learned how important having neat, modularized code is.  
						This is one of my favorite projects that I continue to build upon from time to 
						time.<p>
