		<h2>WorkReadyNH</h2>
			<p>Recently, I completed the WorkReadyNH Program
			in Manchester.  Upon completion, I received both a certificate
			for the program and the National Career Readiness Certificate at
			the Gold level.  I have learned a great deal about soft skills,
			teamwork, and effective communication (be it verbally or written).
			I feel more confident now in both my resume and portfolio,
			both of which will be a continous work in progress, even
			after leaving the course.

		<h2>Ronald Tourgee Computer Science Award</h2>
			<p>Upon graduating from Keene State College,
			I was excited to learn that I was one of the
			recepients of this award.  I was chosen not 
			only because of my outstanding academic performance 
			and work ethics, but also for my dedication to 
			helping everyone around me learn as much as 
			they could in their endeavors toward
			Computer Science degrees as well.  In fact,
			I feel that I am at my best, learning the most
			when I'm around my colleagues and learning 
			together through helping each other.
